#1 When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all 
your work local?

Always... Or any time I may work on the project on a variety of machines 
or with a variety of people, which will probably be most cases.

#2 Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

My local version is the ground I am standing on. I do not wish for the 
sands to shift beneath my feet, paricularly since the remote version 
could be influenced by the experiments or mistakes of others.

#3 Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When 
would you use one instead of another?

#4 What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the 
remote stored locally?

You can compare changes that collaborators may have pushed to the online
repo to your work in the convience and safety of your local environment.

#5 How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would 
be easier, and what would be harder?

Lots of e-mail attachments and shared online drive usage. Probably 
verbally also. Git/hub is easier because once you know the parlance 
and think in those terms, you realize the system was set up to both 
model and reduce inefficiencies in natural workflow. Git/hub is more 
difficult primarily in the sense of start-up knowledge cost, which is 
why this course is so great!


#6 When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
