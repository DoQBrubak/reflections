#1 When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all 
your work local?

Always... Or any time I may work on the project on a variety of machines or 
with a variety of people, which will probably be most cases.

#2 Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
My local version is the ground I am standing on. I do not wish for the sands 
to shift beneath my feet, paricularly since the remote version could be 
influenced by the experiments or mistakes of others.
