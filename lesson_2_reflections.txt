Prompt #1:
What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
Answer:
When I initialize a repository, Git creats a .git folder within the
current diretory. Within that are numerous supporting files. This action
does NOT create a commit. It will organize and tracks future changes to
the versions of my actual project files.

Prompt #2:
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?
Answer:
The staging area is a directory created IN the .git directory 
within the working directory. It is a temporary staging area, for files
prior to committment to the repository. I assume that once the files 
"added" to the staging area are "committed" to the repository, they then
no longer occupy the staging area.
